            The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol
            and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a 
            distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely 
            identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

                So what does the new record for the lowest level of winter
                ice actually mean
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the
                sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will
                continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the
                Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of
                the world, it will always be plunged into bitterly cold
                polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for all kinds of
                natural reasons, thereâ€™s huge variety of the state of the
                ice.
